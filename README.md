🎉 Day 2 Progress Update: Designed Progress Steps with HTML & CSS! 🚀

Hello everyone! 🌟 Excited to share my Day 2 accomplishment in my 30-day coding challenge. Today, I delved into HTML and CSS to create a dynamic progress steps layout!

What I Built:
✅ A visually engaging progress steps component using HTML and styled with CSS.
✅ The steps light up as users navigate, enhancing user experience.
✅ Embracing clean code practices for maintainability and reusability.

I'm truly enjoying this coding journey, and each day brings new insights. A huge shoutout to the supportive coding community for inspiring me to keep pushing my boundaries!
